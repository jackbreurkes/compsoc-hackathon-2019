## Problem
The Climate Science division of the Department of Specific Sciency Matters has identified that people disbelieve scientific facts about climate change and are generally unaware of their day to day impact on the environment.

## Proposed Solution
A resource management game based around reducing your carbon footprint.
The intention is to give our target audience an intuition into how their decisions impact the environment.
We will do this by providing a simple representation of the choices someone would make in their day to day lives, and show the effect of those choices on their carbon footprint.
Each decision will have its associated effect displayed, and these effects will be based on the effect of those decisions in the real world.

The game will be time based, with an allocated amount of real time representing an in game day.
